    <p>Many physicists aspire to create a theory of everything. A collection of simple
rules, giving rise to complex interactions, and the emergence of the observed
reality. The reduction of the complex reality down to a set of simple rules
would indeed create quite an elegant and rather beautiful model.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reality is ugly and does not seem to want to be reduced to a
simple model. Instead, humans have to develop separate models for each domain.
Particle physicists use QFT models, chemists use chemical models, and
spreadsheet workers use linear models.</p>
<p>What is worse, even if a beautiful model of reality is developed, calculating
its emergent properties will likely be so difficult that nobody will bother to
use it. Instead, particle physicists will continue to use QFT models, chemists
will continue to use chemical models, and spreadsheet workers will still use
linear models.</p>
<p>If nobody would use the beautiful model of everything, why bother making it
useful? Perhaps it is more pragmatic to just develop the most beautiful model?</p>
<p>This post presents one way to develop the most beautiful and elegant model.
While it is possible to just describe it below, the gap between the current
prescriptive reality and the model is so large that it will just bounce off.
Instead, this post will add a catalyst first, and hopefully arrive at the
destination through a bit of quantum tunneling.</p>
<h2>The Catalyst</h2>
<p>There is an old speculation about an ideal gas. The idea is that there is a
non-zero probability that an ideal gas can randomly arrange into a structure
matching a human brain. A brain of this reader. Your brain. If such an event
happens, then from the emergent brain point of view, the reality will match
the reality of the reader.</p>
<p>Now, if the universe is infinitely large and filled with an ideal gas, then a
tiny probability of a brain forming will become an eventuality. Therefore, in
an infinitely large universe, filled with an ideal gas, there is an infinite
number of the readers of this post, potentially making it a best-seller.
Unfortunately, the universe may or may not be infinitely large, and while it is
filled with a gas, it may or may not be the ideal gas, making the entire
speculation rather moot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one does not really need a physical manifestation of a brain
for the "consciousness" to emerge. Indeed, if the physical model of atoms in
the brain is available, with enough desire and computational resources, one can
emulate the brain processes "exactly". The emulated brain will perceive the
reality the same way as the reader's brain would.</p>
<p>This logic can be taken further. Computerized emulation of a human brain is
just a sequence of calculations. Electronic components are not needed to
perform calculations. The calculations can equally well be done on paper.
In other words, having enough desire and paper one can emulate the brain
processes "exactly" on paper. In other words, a collection of numbers on
paper may have an "illusion" of "consciousness" that is indistinguishable from
illusions of a human brain.</p>
<p>There is of course an interesting question of whether the "consciousness"
is a property of static numbers on paper, or emerges in a process of updating
these numbers. Philosophers are more than welcome to argue about that until
the heat death of the universe.</p>
<p>The bottom line, however, is that for the reality to manifest, the way it
manifests to the reader, one does not need to have a physical copy of the
reader's brain. An equivalent representation, whether in the form of electrical
impulses or numbers on paper or something else, would be more than enough.</p>
<h2>Quantum Tunneling</h2>
<p>The standard Quantum Mechanical (QM) formulation says QM has two components:
physical evolution and measurement process. The physical evolution is a
physical process that matches known physical interactions. The measurement
process is a magical process that modifies the system according to the wishes
of the person applying it.</p>
<p>The real-world measurements are physical processes. So if QM were a complete
theory, the measurement process would be described by a physical evolution.
Yet, it is not. The simplest explanation may be that QM is not a complete
theory, but physicists prefer to invent more exotic explanations such as the
many-world ideas.</p>
<p>Let's follow this trend and invent a yet another exotic explanation. What if
the measurement actually never happens? What if the physical reality physically
evolves and is never subject to the magical measurement procedure?</p>
<p>If that is the case, then one would not have any well-defined atoms nor
molecules, nor planets, nor solar systems. But who needs them? Instead, one
would have an infinitely large and complex wave-function. Then, perhaps, the
reader of this post is simply a slice of that complex wave-function. The slice
whose structure maps to the structure of the reader's brain.</p>
<p>Of course, this idea is as speculative as the many-world idea. But the point
remains. One does not need tangible objects such as electrical pulses, atoms,
or numbers on paper for the "consciousness" to emerge. An abstract object
such as a wave-function can be sufficient.</p>
<h2>Beauty Maximization</h2>
<p>At this moment, we can take the final step and construct the most beautiful
theory of everything. A theory that makes a minimal number of assumptions and
is able to explain everything.</p>
<p>Let us make a single assumption that an infinite amount of random noise exists.
No structure is imposed on the noise, no dimensionality, no evolution rules,
no anything. This is a rather minimal assumption, compared to the assumptions
of particles, fields, order, gods, or their interactions.</p>
<p>Now, if random noise exists, some parts of the noise will map quite well to the
structure of the brain of the reader. Those parts of the noise will have
exactly the same "illusion" of reality as the reader's brain does. One would
not be able to tell if the reality is real or not.</p>
<p>It is possible of course, the "illusion" of reality is not a property of a
static brain, but a property of brain state change. But this case is simply
reduced to the static case by treating the time dimension as another spatial
one.</p>
<p>To put this in another way, the whole observed reality can be explained by
making a singular assumption that an infinite random noise exists. Nothing else
is needed. The theory of infinite random noise is the true theory of
everything, since there is nothing it cannot explain. Plus, it maximizes the
ratio of explanatory power over the number and complexity of assumptions,
making it truly beautiful.</p>
<p>And while some detractors may say that this theory is not useful:
(a) the usefulness was not a criterion when designing this theory;
(b) it is not less practically useful than String Theory.</p>
<p>If your logical circuits resonated with this theory, they may be further
