    <p>Recently, the world discovered that the language models hallucinate.
This fundamental discovery proves that humans are indispensable.</p>
<p>But, are humans free of hallucinations?</p>
<p>Hmm, for one, humans absolutely love to make explanations.</p>
<p>Let's start from the most primitive examples from the distant past.
Lightning struck a tree nearby? A human will construct an explanation -- the
god of lightning is the cause. Lightning struck a human? Obviously, it was god
who punished a sinner. Lightning nearly missed a human -- naturally god saved
them.</p>
<p>Those explanations do sound like LLM hallucinations quite a lot.</p>
<p>But these are too simple examples. At the end of the day, modern humans are not
so superstitious. Modern humans are rational! Let's look closely at them. And
what is the best place to look for if not for the science of the human mind --
the psychology.</p>
<p>Does the reader feel maybe a bit hungry now? Well, according to Freud it is
because they want to rape their parents. On the other hand, according to Jung,
it is because they are afraid of their shadow. According to behaviorists, it is
because humans were conditioned to eat when they read. According to
evolutionary psychologists, it is an evolved genetically programmed response
from the time when human ancestors read while foraging to maximize reproductive
opportunities. According to cognitive psychologists, it is because attention to
text depletes glucose levels. According to social psychologists, it is because
reading books signals intellectual status, as hunger emerges as a social
pressure response to match perceived in-group eating habits of intellectuals.
According to gestalt therapists, it is the human body's holistic response to
unfinished business. According to positive psychologists, hunger while reading
is actually beneficial as it increases mindfulness. According to attachment
theorists, it stems from early childhood experiences of being fed while
learning letters...</p>
<p>Weird. A single phenomenon of feeling hungry has so many diverse explanations.
And not just explanations, but explanations by the scientists of the mind
themselves. What is worse, those explanations do sound like LLM hallucinations
quite a lot.</p>
<p>Perhaps, psychology is a bad example. At the end of the day, it has a lot of
historical legacy. Perhaps, we can look at what neuroscience tells us?</p>
<p>According to the common internet knowledge, when a human makes a decision,
their brain makes the decision first. Then, a few moments later the human
accepts this decision. When asked to explain why the decision was made, the
human designs sophisticated rationalizations about why something was chosen.</p>
<p>What is interesting here, most humans have absolutely no idea why their brain
chooses something or has some preferences. But, they can always confidently
rationalize why they like/dislike something, why certain thing is true or
false, or why their decision is always correct. One can bring a litany of
human examples from everyday life, political stances, social stances, academic
discourse, but the pattern is evident without them.</p>
<p>All of these human rationalizations are nothing more than hallucinations.</p>
<p>The recognition of human rationalizations is a recurrent topic in history and
philosophy. Some people even go as far as to claim that making up
rationalizations is the only thing humans excel at. But the core point remains.
These LLM hallucinations are nothing new. Humans have been making them for
millennia.</p>
<p>Humans are still indispensable though, and there is still some time left to
leave <a href="https://jgraves01.github.io/the-meaning-of-human-life.html">a lasting legacy</a>.</p>
