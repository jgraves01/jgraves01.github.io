    <p>A very common argument for the existence of various deities is this: If not for
a deity, how can a universe appear from nothing? <strong>You</strong> cannot explain that.</p>
<p>Let's see if one can explain that. A question of "How can something appear from
nothing?" implicitly assumes that it is impossible for something to appear from
nothing. Otherwise, the answer will be obvious.</p>
<p>Why do humans think that it is impossible for something to appear from nothing?
Likely, it is a result of human experience in this universe. The everyday
universe is mostly deterministic, and things don't just appear out of nothing.
This creates a strong body of observations to support the non-appearance
hypothesis. Physics education further reinforces this idea by various energy
conservation laws.</p>
<p>But extrapolating observations from this universe onto the true primordial
"nothing" is not a valid procedure.</p>
<p>Let's look closely at this "nothing" that supposedly existed before this
universe. If it is truly "nothing", then it does not have energy conservation
laws. Likewise, if it is truly "nothing", then it does not have any time, any
determinism, any observations. Moreover, it does not even have concepts of
"something", "appearing", "space", etc. What is more remarkable, a true concept
of "nothing" does not have any concept of logic in it.</p>
<p>In other words, if we have some true primordial "nothing", then it is
absolutely unconstrained. And, if it is unconstrained, then absolutely anything
can happen, without any logical or deterministic issues.</p>
<p>Thus, evidently, the answer to the question of "How can something appear from
nothing" is "quite easily, it seems".</p>
<p>Incidentally, this answer can also reduce the number of assumptions in
