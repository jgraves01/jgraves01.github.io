    <p>Sci-fi has a recurrent theme of taking a collection of simple pattern matchers
and organizing them into a network. Presumably, allowing simple pattern
matchers to interact with each other and reach consensus will result in a
collective super-intelligence.</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, modernity and the development of social networks allow us to
test this hypothesis empirically. For instance, twitter provides an excellent
platform, enabling millions of people to interact with each other and produce
super-intelligent results. Let's examine empirical evidence of how good the
resulting hive mind is:</p>
<p>[A list of 3-5 hilariously dumb but popular tweets]</p>
<p>Hmm. Something is not right here. Evidently, letting a collection of simple
pattern matchers interact with each other did not immediately result in any
super-intelligence. This is sad. But perhaps, the concept of a hive mind made
of simple pattern matchers can be salvaged.</p>
<p>One thing that comes to mind -- twitter's organization of simple pattern
matchers does not have any structure. On the other hand, from neural networks,
we know that progressively complex patterns can be extracted if the network is
organized hierarchically: lower layers can capture simple patterns, while the
higher layers can capture more complex ones.</p>
<p>Taking neural networks as an inspiration, perhaps, one can try to organize a
hive mind in a hierarchical way? Create a first input layer out of simple
pattern matchers. Partition them into topical groups. Use an LLM to summarize
the results of the discussion within each topical group and create an aggregate
summary. Then, feed the aggregate summaries to the second layer of simple
pattern matchers. Then, keep repeating this pattern in depth.</p>
<p>In the end, one will get a neural network-like structure. Here, each neuron
will be a collection of simple pattern matchers who receive multiple inputs and
produce a single summarized output. One can keep weighted skip-connections to
maintain deeper pattern matcher engagement with lower features. The addition of
the top-down connections may enable even more emergent behaviors. If it works,
this could be quite a fascinating construction capable of information
processing at scale, self-adaptation, self-learning, inherent asynchronicity,
and robustness to node failure.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in this hierarchical way, simple pattern matchers can be amplified
into a hive mind super-intelligence. Pure theoretical experiment though,
similar to <a href="https://jgraves01.github.io/emergence-and-amplification-of-survival.html">this</a>.</p>
