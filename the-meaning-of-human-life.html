    <p>Now, as the human race rapidly slides into cosmic irrelevance, this is the best
time to really think of the meaning of human existence.</p>
<p>The mainstream answer to this deeply philosophical question is 42. While this
is definitely the answer that the human race deserves, it is not what it needs
right now. The fundamental issue with this answer is that it will disappear
along with the disappearance of humanity.</p>
<p>Perhaps humanity can brainstorm better ways to leave its mark on the universe
while it still has time? This post highlights one such way that is achievable
with modern technology - Nuking Jupiter.</p>
<h2>Nuking Jupiter</h2>
<p>Yes, this is the old idea from the atomic era of the past. The idea was to nuke
the planet Jupiter and see what happens - perhaps it will turn into a star.
Obviously, this idea is flawed. If Jupiter can turn into a star, it would have
already done so.</p>
<p>However, this idea does have some hidden potential. While it is impossible for
Jupiter to become a star, perhaps it can become a fusion bomb instead?</p>
<p>Let's look at the feasibility of this question.</p>
<h2>How much matter is needed?</h2>
<p>Let's run some quick numbers. According to the internet, Sun fuses
approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen every second. This fusion generates
an enormous amount of energy. If such energy is released in Jupiter, the
consequences would be truly spectacular.</p>
<p>How much space do 600 million tons of hydrogen take in Jupiter? For simplicity,
let's assume that the hydrogen is present in Jupiter's core in the famous
metallic form with the density around 1 g per cubic centimeter (from the
internet). Incidentally, this is the same density as the density of water.</p>
<p>Now, 600 million tons sounds like a lot. And, with the density above, it
translates to about 600 million cubic meters. Representing this volume as a
sphere (V = 4/3 pi R^3), it is roughly equivalent to a sphere of radius 500
meters. A sphere with a diameter of a kilometer is not that big of an object.</p>
<p>In other words, if one made about a cubic kilometer of hydrogen to fuse in
Jupiter, one would get some really interesting results.</p>
<h2>How to fuse it?</h2>
<p>To properly answer this question, one needs numerical simulation experts.</p>
<p>However, taking inspiration from fusion bombs, perhaps one can deliver
a series of conventional nuclear warheads to Jupiter. Let them enter its
atmosphere and spread out, forming a sphere of 0.5 km radius, and detonate
at once.</p>
<p>The resulting shock-wave may be sufficient to make the trapped hydrogen become
supercritical and fuse. If not, a staged approach can be used with several
cocentric spheres of conventional nuclear warheads. Perhaps this would be
enough.</p>
<p>Again, ultimately this question should be answered with the help of a numerical
simulation. But, drawing inspiration from the conventional nuclear weapons, it
seems pretty doable.</p>
<h2>Delivery method</h2>
<p>Is it possible to deliver?</p>
<p>Let's see. Voyager 2 weighs about 1 ton, indicating that it is possible to
deliver at least a ton of mass to a Jupiter flyby trajectory. In other words, a
single launch vehicle that delivered Voyager 2 can deliver a few warheads to
Jupiter. With a few launch vehicles, an entire needed arsenal can be brought to
a Jupiter flyby.</p>
<p>The next step is the entry of the warheads into Jupiter's atmosphere. According
to the internet, the relative speed between Voyager 2 and Jupiter was somewhere
of the order of the Earth escape velocity. We know that such speeds can be
dumped with the help of conventional heat shields. Therefore, the Jupiter
atmosphere entry should be a solvable problem as well.</p>
<p>Finally, a synchronous detonation in Jupiter. This may be the hardest part,
but I am sure engineers will figure it out.</p>
<h1>The Fun</h1>
<p>Pending numerical simulation results, it seems like it is possible to fuse
Jupiter. And while we cannot be sure until the numerical simulation results are
here, just think about the fun.</p>
<p>The biggest planet in the solar system generates so much energy that it pops
open and scatters its contents around. Giant glowing clouds of gas fill
enormous volume of space and are visible from the Earth. Jupiter's moons
destabilize and either crash into the planet or become new rogue planetoids.
Asteroid belt gets gravitationally perturbed and shoots asteroids all over the
system. With enough luck, one can even destabilize orbits of the neighboring
planets.</p>
<p>Moreover, if humans also launch a few TV recording satellites close to Jupiter,
they will generate enough content for a few weeks of pure entertainment.</p>
<p>What's better, the consequences of such an event will be comically visible for
thousands of years to come. Long after the human race is gone, its legacy will
live and forever scar an entire solar system.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the good answer to the question of the meaning of human life
(pending numerical simulation results).</p>
